Multisite Language Switcher Theme
=================================

About
-----

This Theme is a hack for multilingual blog using multisite wordpress. It redirect users from "/" to "/en/" or "/fr/" in function of the accepted languages of the browser.
The Theme redirect the 404 error page too.

This theme is a quick and dirty hack for my multilingual blog [(http://oncleben31.cc)](http://oncleben31.cc). I don't have any competency in Theme development. 
Don't hesitate to fork and improve it.


Set-up Instructions
-------------------

Install this theme on your network and use this theme for the root blog (which is useless).

TODO
----
* use theme option to set the languages
* don't use only the prefered language ($Langue[0]), use the others.
